              <p>Tonya Lewis Lee created Movita to help women gain a baseline of good nutrition, and a practice of positive choices that support a lifestyle of well-being. Tonya’s professional journey into health and wellness started in 2007 when she began serving as the National Spokesperson for the “A Healthy Baby Begins with You” campaign initiated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. It was through this work as a women’s health advocate that her own health journey took form, ultimately embarking on a lifestyle of wellness. This personal health journey coupled with her entrepreneurial spirit led Tonya to create Movita for women.</p>
