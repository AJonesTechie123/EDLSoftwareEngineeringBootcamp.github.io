    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Iceland</h1>
   <p><i><b>Iceland</b></i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice coexist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

    <p>The Aurora borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawnaurora and the greek name for the north wind Boreas.From September to April Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particulates emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green straks across the skies.</p>

    <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake- namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the S&oacute;lheimaj&ouml;kull and Svinafellsj&ouml;kull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>
